#Contributions:
Joao Contributed 50% of this project and Nicolas Arteaga 50%. We both did all steps back home and
met to discuss them. Then both tested the transducers with different test cases back home.
We created the metaphone and the inverted metaphone all together in our last meeting thanks to the
lecture slides.


#STEPS Explanations:
The solutions for the steps were basicaly the same for each one of them. We had the 
general case (Accepting all words) and then we divided them in small cases distributed 
for each state(or states) of the transducer. So we applied the changes required for each step.

!Note! : Step 9 has the same content as StepX, but weirdly StepX is working and 9 isn't. After much
testing we could not explain it, so we are sending both files. (Same testing in line 129 run.sh) 

#MetaphoneLN: 
	We created the metaphone by making a Composition of all transducer steps. (line 26 run.sh)

#InvertMethaphoneLN:
	We were able to invert our metaphone with the fstinvert command. (line 41 run.sh)

#Metaphone Analysis
	Our Metaphone is usable and error free. It uses the 9 steps like a phonetic algorithm to
	associate the input with a word that sounds similar. To use write the word in a t-*.str file
	in the test folder as explained in the lab.

#Analysis of the usability of the "inverted" metaphoneLN transducer:
	The inverted metaphone cannot really recover the word state before it went in the metaphone.
	Since the transducer loses the information and generalizes. For example the word "JRFSK" can 
	represent Jurafsky, Jarofsky, Jarovsky e Jarovski so the inverted metaphone cannot go back
	to one of those.
	Another example would be NN that represents Nuno, Nunu, Nonu, Nono.
	In our Names example, "NICOLASGARCIA" went to "NCLSGRKS" but the inverted metaphone delivered
	"NACLSGRRX". "JOAOMAURICIO" -> "JMRKS" --inverted--> "JAMRRX".
	With testing we could see that the inverted metaphone always delivered a vowel "A"
	between the first two consonants, probably because of the inversion of Step 9 which
	droped most vowels previously.
